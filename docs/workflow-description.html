<div id="data-in" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data in</h2>
<p>Data from different sources are retrieved, harmonized and stored locally in a PostGreSQL/PostGIS database. This is done by scripting, so that it is easy to update. Data are then made available via a Geoserver for easy retrieval by users. For use in validation scripts, the data can be queried and downloaded in a ready-to-use form via scripting in Matlab, Python or R. This document describes this process.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-out" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Data out</h2>
<p>The Geoserver provides a Web Feature Service (WFS). The service is called by a URL. In the URL, specifications and criteria can be included.</p>
<p>Geoserver can deliver different formats, e.g.Â csv text. This is shown in the next examples. Calling the URL starts the download of this csv file. The file can be downloaded to your local machine, or read directly into an object in your favourite scripting language</p>
<p>Currently, three tables are available in the Geoserver:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Locations and parameters</li>
<li>Observations - all observations (1.4 million). It is unwise to download all data in the observations table at once. The first 50 records can be downloaded with
<a href="http://nwdm.avi.directory.intra/geoserver/NWDM/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typeName=NWDM:measurement_view&amp;outputFormat=csv&amp;maxFeatures=50" class="uri">http://nwdm.avi.directory.intra/geoserver/NWDM/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typeName=NWDM:measurement_view&amp;outputFormat=csv&amp;maxFeatures=50</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="locations" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Locations</h2>
<p>All unique locations in the database. The table can be downloaded using the url: <a href="http://nwdm.avi.directory.intra/geoserver/NWDM/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typeName=NWDM:location&amp;outputFormat=csv" class="uri">http://nwdm.avi.directory.intra/geoserver/NWDM/ows?service=WFS&amp;version=1.0.0&amp;request=GetFeature&amp;typeName=NWDM:location&amp;outputFormat=csv</a></p>
<p>Below is a map with all locations currently in the database. Data is read into an r dataframe using read_csv from the readr (tidyverse) package, converted to a spatial object, transformed to a suitable coordinate reference system for interactive plotting, and plotted using the leaflet library.</p>
