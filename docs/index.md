# Background

Several projects have a need for model validation data for the (Greater) North Sea. Current modeling efforts comprise hydrodynamics, sediment, water quality and ecological modeling. Validation data therefore comprise a large number of data from different origin, and different standards. The objective of this memo is to propose and agree on a common data format for validation data for North Sea models: both hydrodynamics, water quality and ecology.
